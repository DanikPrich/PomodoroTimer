The project on GitHub is a Pomodoro Timer built with React.js. It was created solely by me.

A Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool that helps users stay focused and manage their time efficiently. The technique involves breaking work sessions into 25-minute intervals, followed by 5-minute breaks. After completing four work sessions, a longer break of 15-20 minutes is taken.

The Pomodoro Timer project has the following features:

1. Timer: The timer displays the time remaining for the current work or break session.

2. Start, Pause, and Reset buttons: Users can start, pause, and reset the timer as needed.

3. Session and break length customization: Users can adjust the length of work sessions and breaks to fit their preferences.

4. Audio notification: A sound is played when the timer reaches zero to alert users of the end of a session.

The project has a minimalist design, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to focus on their work without distractions. Overall, the Pomodoro Timer project is a helpful tool for anyone looking to manage their time more effectively and increase productivity.
